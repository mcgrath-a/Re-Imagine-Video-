        review their life's actions to validate their place for eternity.
        Players are subjected to harsh examination by heavenly entities (Good
        Guy and Bad Guy), who assess all deeds and intentions. The difficulty is
        demonstrating one's merit in reaching paradise or meeting a grim fate.

          Let's first discuss the physical haptic elements of our game, which
          include the 'Big Book' and the 'stamp.' If you've seen the video—or
          even just the first 15 seconds—you'll notice a question posed,
          instructing players to write their response in the Big Book. This book
          is crucial at both the beginning and end of the game. Alongside it, we
          have a stamp marked ‘DENIED,’ which plays a vital role in the game’s
          final task. While I won’t spoil the ending, the book provides a
          tangible way for players to interact with the game, and the stamp adds
          a sense of permanence to the players' actions.

            Fig.3 - Here, you see the famous 'Big Book,' which players were
            instructed to write entries in before our viewing. With the
            storyline of our game, there had to be a few other entries in the
            book before the players played, so each group member took turns
            writing (1-2) 'fake' entries answering the prompt. These images are
            thanks to a reviewer from the product listing on Amazon website.

            Fig.4 - The 'DENIED' stamp plays a significant role in the game
            towards the end. Stamping this feels unexplainable; it is very
            haptic and permanent; you can't erase it.

          Our setup at the arcade differed from other groups. While most games
          were playable on-site, our game was featured at our table alongside
          our flyers, with two of us there to greet attendees and inform them
          that our main presentation would occur at 3:30 PM in the Critical
          Making Studio, located just to the right of our table. The studio was
          set up like a movie screening—large screen, chairs arranged for
          viewing, and lights off—creating the perfect atmosphere for guests to
          experience our interactive video game.

          <figcaption>
            Fig.5 - Ama welocming in partcipants. As you see on the screen, the
            image we had thumbnailed while participants came in was "Write why
            you desire to go to the good place in the Big Book." Unbeknownst to
            any of the context of our game, this was the first task we asked
            players to engage in before the game started.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Here are some helpful instructions for those who are inspired by our
          game and want to recreate this installation remotely in your
          environment.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Get the following materials ready: a book of some sort. This could
              be a folded stack of papers, a small journal, loose pieces of
              paper, napkins, or whatever is readily available to you that you
              can flip through with enough pages per person participating.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the original installation, we used a 'DENIED' stamp with red
              ink. In this installation version, you can use a red (or any
              colored) marker and, in the end, cross out an entry by doing an
              'X'; if you don't have a marker, you could choose to rip the page
              someone is rejecting.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Also, it is recommended that you play with at least 2 other people
              (so 3 in total). The game will be more fun this way.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Finally, as you immerse yourself in the game, dim the lights,
              ensure the audio is clear for all participants, play the video
              FULL SCREEN, try not to conversate with other partcipants, and
              most importantly, have a blast!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
